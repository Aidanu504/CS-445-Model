This is a sample text for the hybrid encryption/decryption system
It combines both features from chacha20 and serpent
allowing for a combination of both stream and block cipher 
it outputs the stream ciphertext as well as the block ciphertext
then once decrypted it checks the decryption to the original plaintext
ensuring if ur output is correct or not
